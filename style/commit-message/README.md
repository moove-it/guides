# Commit Message Style Guide

Conventions for commit messages:

1. The first line should summarize what the commit does.
2. The first line of the commit message shouldn't have a period at the end.
3. The first line of the commit message should not be larger than 50 
characters.
4. Use present tense in imperative, present tense for the first line.
5. The first line must be followed by a blank new line.
6. A brief description explaining the change, between 2-4 lines  long, 
should follow the new line.
7. If needed, you can opt to add another blank line, and below, 
a bulleted list of individual changes prefixed with a star (\*).
8. None of these additional lines should exceed 70 characters.
